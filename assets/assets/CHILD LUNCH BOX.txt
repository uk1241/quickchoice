This is a children's lunch box that is a common hybrid stainless steel/plastic bento box design. This style is very popular for school kids as it combines the safety of steel with the appealing look and convenience of plastic.
Material and SMade of Food-Grade Stainless Steel.
Highly durable, rust-free, easy to clean, does not retain food odors or colors, and is a safe, non-toxic material (BPA-free).
Outer Shell/Lid: Made from Durable Plastic 
Benefit: Provides lightweight strength, allows for bright colors and fun prints (like the Unicorn design), and helps keep the overall weight down for children.


Note: While the outer box is often leak-proof, the seals between the inner compartments are often not perfectly sealed, meaning a sauce may leak into the next compartment if the box is tipped on its side.

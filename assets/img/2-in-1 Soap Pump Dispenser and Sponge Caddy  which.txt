2-in-1 Soap Pump Dispenser and Sponge Caddy, which is a specialized kitchen accessory designed to streamline the dishwashing process.
This product is an innovative, space-saving sink organizer that combines a liquid dish soap dispenser with a designated sponge holder (caddy).
One-Handed Dispensing: It features a press-type pump mechanism on top. You simply press the top plate or the sponge directly onto the pump to dispense a measured amount of liquid soap directly onto the sponge or scrubber.
The integrated caddy keeps the wet sponge or scrubber off the countertop, which helps keep the sink area dry, clean, and organized.
The design is engineered to reduce soap waste by delivering a precise amount with each pump, making dishwashing faster and more efficient.
